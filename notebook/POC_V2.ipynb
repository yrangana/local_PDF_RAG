(Document name: Think_and_Grow_Rich ; Page number: Not specified; Paragraph number: Not specified; First sentence: Broadly speaking, there are two types of people in the world.)\n",

       "4. **Remove limitations**: FAITH removes limitations! (Document name: Think_and_Grow_Rich ; Page number: 43; Paragraph number: Not specified; First sentence: FAITH removes limitations!)\n",

       "6. **Acquire facts and think accurately**: Most people are too indifferent or lazy to acquire FACTS with which to THINK ACCURATELY. (Document name: Think_and_Grow_Rich ; Page number: 80; Paragraph number: Not specified; First sentence: 29.)\n",
